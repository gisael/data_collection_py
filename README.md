# Python's Data Collection Guide

We all know Python, as all other programming languages has its own data types. These are the different ways of classify data objects. Depending on the type of the object created, there are different operations that can be performed on a particular type of data. 

For this guide, we are not going to talk about the commond standard built-in data types (i.e. integer, floar, string, boolean, etc) we are going to focus on the different data collection types that exists in python and are usefull for data science.

- list
- tuples
- ranges
- dictionaries
- arrays
- matrices
- pandas dataframe

The idea of this guide is to serve as a clean, and precise quick reference for novice pythonians, worth having handing when jumping into the data analysis world for the first time.
